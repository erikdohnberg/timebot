== Timebot

This is an IRC bot that provides answers to any questions about the time, date, time-zone, etc. I'm particularily happy with the use of hashes which enables the bot to recognize specific words regardless of sequence. This makes it possible to ask grammatically incorrect questions and questions about like "what day of the week is it? / what day of the month is it?"
